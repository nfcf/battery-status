# Battery Status

Keep track of your battery information in a seamless way!
This app runs in the background collecting you battery level, voltage, temperature and plugged state and sends this information to your Pachube account. If you don't have one, just go to https://xively.com/signup (Pachube was renamed to Cosm...and later to Xively) and create a username and a password. The app will take care of the rest (actually I believe since Xively, you also need to create a device through the site.

**Note:** I wrote this application back in **2012** while learning to code for Android, and I haven't maintained it much... That's why I decided to open-sourced it - should have done it way back then I know...
